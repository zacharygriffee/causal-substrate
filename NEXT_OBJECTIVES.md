# Next Objectives

Status: lane guide, not a fixed task list. Causal Substrate agents should
choose the next small operational improvement inside the causal observer role.

## Current Lane

Causal Substrate observes and interprets selected seam-history material. It
preserves ids, hashes, refs, provenance, and linkage status while classifying
compatible, damaged, and unresolved happenings.

Causal Substrate does not claim canonical truth, Layer admission, RBC
interpretation, quorum satisfaction, Mesh publication, authority, or production
continuity.

## Completed Local Seam-History Observation Surface

The local supplied-material lane can now:

- consume supplied Edge/Layer seam-history material and emit bounded causal
  observations;
- classify linked request/receipt material as
  `compatible_seam_happening`;
- classify damaged or unlinked request/receipt material as
  `unresolved_or_damaged_seam_happening`;
- emit readback contracts, contract snapshots, completion gates, Edge
  projection fixtures, Edge consumer fixtures, and Edge handoff bundles;
- preserve request ids/hashes, receipt ids/hashes, source repos, durable refs,
  writer refs, linkage status, proof labels, and non-claim boundaries;
- expose Hyperswarm-readiness, real-run instructions, report readback, and
  durable-record source-ref completeness surfaces without treating instructions
  or supplied reports as live swarm proof.

Strongest routinely proven rung in normal tests:
`local_causal_observation_over_supplied_seam_history_material`.

The real Hyperswarm reader remains a higher proof lane only when the
environment-gated command actually runs against durable replicated material.

## Good Next Moves

Choose work that improves bounded causal observation:

- Add a JSON CLI output for the Edge handoff bundle if Edge wants a single file
  rather than separate observation, snapshot, fixture, and gate artifacts.
- Add negative cases for incomplete handoff bundles and report readbacks.
- Add a checked command path for `CAUSAL_SUBSTRATE_REAL_HYPERSWARM=1` that
  writes both the reader report and report readback artifact, then document the
  exact resulting proof rung.
- Accept a Layer-side receipt runtime/evidence report as adjacent causal input
  only when Layer owns and labels that report; do not decide admission.
- Add a narrow Edge-consumer contract test once Edge chooses the handoff bundle
  shape it wants to project.

## Handoff Expectations

When handing material back to Edge, Layer, or Spine, include:

- observation artifact id and schema;
- observed source request ids/hashes;
- observed receipt ids/hashes;
- source repos;
- durable refs and writer refs;
- classification and linkage status;
- strongest proof rung;
- non-claims and deferred attachment points.

Edge may consume the handoff bundle or the consumer fixture as observation-only
projection input. Causal Substrate still does not write Edge projection state.

## Look Outward When

- Causal work is refining local fixtures while Edge/Layer have durable seam
  history ready to consume.
- A higher proof rung is tempting but input came from supplied JSON, files,
  stdin/stdout, direct imports, or fixtures.
- Layer receipt/evidence refs would need Layer admission interpretation.
- Edge needs a projection-safe result shape before more Causal internals.

## Guardrail

No swarm-carried communication, no seam proof. A Causal observation over
supplied material is useful, but it is not DHT/Hyperswarm-derived seam proof.

Instructions artifacts, readiness reports, static fixtures, JSON files, and
operation-shaped report readbacks are lower proof rungs unless the reader
actually consumed durable DHT/Hyperswarm-derived seam history.
